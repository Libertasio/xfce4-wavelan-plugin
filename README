WaveLAN plugin for the XFce4 panel.

Displays various information about a WaveLAN device:

* Vendor name (currently, only the wi* and awi* devices vendors are recognized)
* Signal state (tells if a carrier signal was detected)
* Signal quality (current quality of the carrier signal)
* Network name (current SSID of the WaveLAN network)

At the time of this writing only NetBSD and FreeBSD are supported, whereas
only NetBSD is known to work. Tested with NetBSD 1.6ZE and 1.6U using a
Lucent wi* device.

Contributions for other plattforms such as Linux are very much welcome, as
testers for NetBSD < 2.0 and FreeBSD are.
