xfce4-wavelan-plugin - A WaveLAN plugin for the XFce4 panel.
===================
https://docs.xfce.org/panel-plugins/xfce4-wavelan-plugin

Displays various information about a WaveLAN device:

* Signal state (tells if a carrier signal was detected)
* Signal quality (current quality of the carrier signal)
    Note that the latter is in % on Linux and in dBm on BSDs. Hence, on BSDs, the
    progressbar may be never full, as dBm is not easily comparable to a maximum.
* Network name (current SSID of the WaveLAN network)

At the time of this writing NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD and Linux are supported.
